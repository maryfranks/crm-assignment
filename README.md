[See assignment in Alexa.](https://alexa.bitmaker.co/cohorts/67/assignments/2027/latest)

Software developers use "user stories" as a guide to know what to implement. They serve as descriptions of the interactions that users should be able to have with the application. Below we have written out all of the user stories for the CRM. Use these as a to-do list or guide when making your app.

As a user, upon starting the CRM, I am presented with a prompt to add, modify, delete, display all, search by attribute, and exit.
As a user, if I select add I am prompted to enter a 'first name', 'last name', 'email' and 'note'.
As a user, if I select modify I am prompted to enter an id for the contact to be modified.
As a user, when I enter the id of the user I want to modify I am then prompted to select which attribute I want to change from the list 'first name', 'last name', 'email', or 'note'.
As a user, when I enter the attribute I want to change I am then prompted to enter a new value for the attribute.
As a user, if I select delete I am then prompted to enter the id of the contact I want to delete.
As a user, if I select display all I am then shown all of the contacts that exist.
As a user, if search by attribute is selected, I am prompted to select which attribute I want to search by.
As a user, when I choose which attribute I want to search by, I am then prompted to enter the search term.
As a user, when I enter the search term I am then presented with the first contact who matches my search.
As a user, if I select exit I am returned to the command line.
